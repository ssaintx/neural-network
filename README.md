This repository contains a neural network that predicts a number. The model has been implemented using Python with Numpy and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries. The code is structured in a clear and organized manner, with detailed 
comments explaining each step of the process. The user can easily modify the training parameters and input data to fine-tune the model. The results are presented visually, allowing for easy interpretation of the model's 
performance. This project is a great introduction to neural networks and can serve as a starting point for more complex applications.
